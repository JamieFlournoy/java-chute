# Pervasive Code's Java Chute

This library includes classes for simplifying producer/consumer parallel processing using a channel-like data structure called a Chute.

## Chute?

A Chute is a closable conduit from producers to consumers  of objects of a given type. It is unidirectional and typed, similar to a bounded queue but with a substantially smaller API than [java.util.Queue][Queue].

The API is deliberately limited to operations that are suited to a pool of competing workers. Additionally, the producer and consumer interfaces are separate (`ChuteEntrance` and `ChuteExit`), easing implementation of delegating wrapper classes that enhance basic chutes. Several examples of such classes are included with this library:

* a **multiplexer**, allowing multiple producers to feed a single ChuteEntrance, with the ChuteEntrance only becoming closed when all of the producers have signaled that they are finished;
* a **transforming entrance** and a **transforming exit,** allowing flexibility in deciding whether producers or consumers execute the transformation function;
* an **Iterable** implementation that represents a ChuteExit in a way that is easy to use in a `foreach` loop, and which is suitable for such use by multiple workers, each of which will see their own subset of the Chute's contents;
* executable **workers** that process elements taken from a ChuteExit, putting the results into a ChuteEntrance; and
* a wrapper that allows a **nonblocking listener** to handle elements from a large number of ChuteExits.

## Overview of included classes

Javadocs are available on `javadoc.io`:

See the separate [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) file for a description of what interfaces and classes are included.
(Overview content is taken from class Javadoc comments, so there's no need to read both.)

## Alternatives to this library

A list of [alternatives to this library](ALTERNATIVES.md) is included to help you determine whether this library is right for you.

## Including it in your project

Use groupId `com.pervasivecode`, name `chute`, version `0.10` in your build tool of choice.


### Gradle Example

If you are using Gradle 4.x, put this in your build.properties file:

```
// in your build.gradle's repositories {} block:
    mavenCentral();

// in your build.gradle's dependencies {} block:
    implementation 'com.pervasivecode:chute:0.10'

    // or, if you prefer the separated group/name/version syntax:
    implementation group: 'com.pervasivecode', name: 'chute', version: '0.10'
```


## How to use it in your code

See the [Example Code][] section in [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) for details.

## Contributing

See [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md) and [GRADLE_INTRO.md](GRADLE_INTRO.md) if you want to build and hack on the code yourself.
